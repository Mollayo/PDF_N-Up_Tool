# PDF N-Up Tool
An Android app to print multiple pages per sheet.

This app allows the user to print more than one page of a PDF onto a single sheet of paper. Printing multiple pages per sheet is also called N-up printing (such as 2-up or 6-up). The user can specify the number of copies along the width and the height of the sheet as well as the paper orientation (portrait or landscape). A typical use is to print the presentation slides; the user can choose to print 2, 4 or even 8 slides per sheet.
